Currently just a backup for dotfiles. Customization on bashrc has been minimal, much of vimrc is copypasta and/or messy.

Most of the current bashrc is the default from Pop!_OS.

TODO:
  - implement better backup management
  - personalize bashrc
  - comments for bashrc
  - have vimrc autoinstall vim-plug and plugins if not installed
  - setup better autocomplete windows (not typescript language server unless typescript)
  - implement shell script for setup
